## General setup

1. Clone the repository by using the download button or terminal. 
2. Open "R/R.Rproj" using RStudio. 
3. This project uses [https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html](renv) for project-local R dependency management. Run `renv::restore()` in the console if it's the first time you open the project or `renv::status()` to check the status of your R environment. Be aware it may take some time (please go and grab a coffee).
