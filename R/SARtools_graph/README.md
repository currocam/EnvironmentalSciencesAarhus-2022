This directory is for creating a plot from SARtools data. It expects one input data file in R/SARtools_graph/data directory per group and will produce figures in R/SARtools_graph/figures. 

It's meant for running interactively inside RStudio. Please, open R/SARtools_graph/R/figure-01.R, edit the head of the file and run the script line per line (after copying your data into data directory).
